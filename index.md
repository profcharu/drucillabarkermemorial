## Speaking Truth to Power: A Tale of Two Universities
This essay was the last article Drue ever published.
It was published online a couple days after she passed away.
It compares the experiences of resistance and accommodation by the University of South Carolina (USC) and Boğaziçi University to the imposition of a right-wing head of university by government fiat.
It is available on [Sage Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/04866134221139310) for a limited time, as well as on [this site](/assets/Speaking Truth to Power: A Tale of Two Universities.pdf).
